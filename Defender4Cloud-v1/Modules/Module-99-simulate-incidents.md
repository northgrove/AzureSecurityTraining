<p align="left"><img src="../Images/asc-labs-intermediate.gif?raw=true"></p>

#### ðŸŽ“ Level: 200 (Intermediate)
#### âŒ› Estimated time to complete this lab: 30 minutes


## Anonymous access to Azure resources

To simulate anonymous access we use the TOR browser to anonyminize your IP when accessing the azure portal or the service directly.
> ! NB: We don't recomend using the TOR browser in a production environment. 

TOR Browser download: [Download TOR Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)

### Login to the Azure Portal

1. start the TOR browser and access https://portal.azure.com
2. Log in to your lab environment


### Access a storage account content with TOR Browser
Creating Access Policy and URL for Storage account content:
1. In the Azure portal browse for **Storage accounts**
2. Locate the account part of the lab: **asclabxxxxxxx**
3. Browse the account an navigate to **Containers** in the sidebar
4. Click on one of the existing Containers, ie **azure-webjobs-hosts**
5. Brows the folder to you find a file. Or upload a file by your self.
6. Click on the file choosen
7. Click on **Genereate SAS** on the top tabs
8. Use deault settings and click on **Generate SAS token and URL**
9. Copy and keep the **Blob SAS URL**

Access the content from TOR Browser
1. Start the TOR browser
2. Paste the **Blob SAS URL** in the addressbar
   
### Accessing a key vault with TOR Browser
1. In the Azure Portal browse for **Key vaults**
2. Locate the key vault part of the lab: **asclab-kv-xxxxx**
3. Browse the key vault and navigate to **Secrets** in the sidebar
4. 



## Simulate alerts on a Windows VM

### Simulate suspicious powershell command
1. Login to the target computer, asclab-win
    - Login information can be reset using the "reset password" functionality on the VM in the Azure portal.
2. Create a folder 'c:\test-MDATP-test'
3. Open a command-line window
4. At the prompt, copy and run the following command. The command prompt window will close automatically.
   ```
   powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe', 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe'); Start-Process 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe'
   ```
If the command is successful, you'll see a new alert on the workload protection dashboard and in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal. This alert might take a few minutes to appear.
5. To review the alert in Defender for Cloud, go to **Security alerts > Suspicious Powershell commandline**



### Download Eicar
1. Login to the target computer, asclab-win
    - Login information can be reset using the "reset password" functionality on the VM in the Azure portal.
2. browse to: https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/
3. Download one of the eicar files. ie eicar_com.zip



## Simulate AKS alert on Microsoft Defender for Cloud
To simulate AKS alert on a cluster that is protected under Microsoft Defender for Cloud follow the following steps: 
1. From [**Azure Cloud shell**](https://shell.azure.com) login to the AKS subscription by running these commands
```
az login 
az account set --subscription "MyAzureSubID"
```
2. Authenticate to the AKS cluster
```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <your resource group name> --name asclab-aks 
```
3. Run the alert simulation command below
```
kubectl get pods --namespace=asc-alerttest-662jfi039n
```
4. Look for a AKS related alert in Defender for Cloud
> Defender for Cloud test alert for Kubernetes (not a threat)
