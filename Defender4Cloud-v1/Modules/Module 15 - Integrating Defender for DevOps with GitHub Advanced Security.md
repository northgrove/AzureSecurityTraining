#### ðŸŽ“ Level: 200 (Intermediate)
#### âŒ› Estimated time to complete this lab: 45 minutes

## Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn how to configure GitHub Connector in Defender for DevOps.

### Exercise 1: Preparing the Environment

If you alredy finished [Module 1](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Modules/Module-1-Preparing-the-Environment.md) of this lab, you can skip this exercise, otherwise plesae finish at least Exercise 1, 2 and 3 from Module 1.

### Exercise 2: Creating an GitHub Trial account

1.	Open an In-Private session in your web browser and navigate to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
2.	If this is the first time you're creating GitHub account, enter the UserName, Password and email address and follow the screen to create a new account 
3.	Type your Account email address and Password and login to your GitHub environment.

### Exercise 3: Obtain trial of GitHub Enterprise Cloud account
#### NOTE: GitHub Advanced Security is available for Enterprise accounts on GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. Some features of GitHub Advanced Security are also available for public repositories on GitHub.com. For more information, see GitHubâ€™s products.


For the purpose of this lab, weâ€™re setting up a trial to evaluate GitHub Enterprise Cloud. To get a Trial version of GitHub Enterprise Cloud, click [here](https://github.com/organizations/enterprise_plan?ref_cta=Try%2520Enterprise&ref_loc=user_drawer_side_panel&ref_page=Header+Avatar). This will be a 30-day trial and you donâ€™t need to provide a payment method during the trial unless you add GitHub marketplace apps to your organization that require a payment method. 

#### Create an Github organization

1. From the link above, choose **Enterprise cloud**

#### Fork a couple of repos

To have some security issues to detect, you could **fork** a couple of repos. Fork these two repos into your organization:

>
> https://github.com/github/code-scanning-javascript-demo
>
> https://github.com/microsoft/windows-containers-demos
>

For each repo do:

1. Click on the **Fork** button in top right corner
   ![Fork](../Images/Git-ForkARepo.png?raw=true)
2. Choose your Organization as the owner of the new repo
   ![Fork owner](../Images/Git-ForkChooseOrg.png?raw=true)
3. In the new repository, forked from the original. Click on **Setting** and then **Code security and Analyst** from the left sidebar.
4. Enable **Dependabot alerts**, **Dependabot security updates**, **Dependency graph**, **Private vulnerability reporting** and **Secret scanning** (located at the bottom)
   ![Enable Code Security](../Images/Git-EnableCodeSecurity.png)
5. In the **Code scanning** section, Click **Set up** right to **CodeQL analysis** and choose **Advanced** (Choose Default if available)
   ![Code scanning](../Images/Git-CodeScanning.png)
6. Commit the **CodeQL.yml** file by clicking **Start Commit** in top right corner. Type in an apropriate heading and description. Click **Commit new file**
   ![Commit CodeQL](../Images/Git-CommitCodeQL.png)
7. To see the code scanning running, click on **Actions** in the top menu bar.

Repeat the same steps for the other Github repo.



### Exercise 4: Connecting your GitHub organization

1.	Login to your Azure Portal and navigate to Defender for Cloud dashboard
2.	In the left navigation pane, click **Environment settings** option
3.	Click the **Add environment** button and click **GitHub (preview)** option. The **Create GitHub connection** page appears as shown the sample below.

          5.0.x
          6.0.x
          
    - name: Run Microsoft Security DevOps
      uses: microsoft/security-devops-action@preview
      continue-on-error: false
      id: msdo
      with:
        categories: 'IaC'

    - name: Upload alerts to Security tab
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: ${{ steps.msdo.outputs.sarifFile }}

9.	Once this job completes running, navigate to the Security tab > Click on Code scanning 

NOTE: if you donâ€™t see anything is because your code scanning feature is disabled in GitHub. Refer to the prerequisites section of this lab to review the instructions to enable. 

10.	If you see No code scanning alerts here, In the filter of Code scanning tab, choose is:open tool: Notice the available tools Defender for DevOps uses.
