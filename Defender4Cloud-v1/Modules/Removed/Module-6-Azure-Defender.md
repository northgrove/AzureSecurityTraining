## Objectives
This exercise guides you how

### Exercise 1: Alert validation

Here letâ€™s cover the new Alert Simulation

1.	1.	Go to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and click the Security Alerts in the sidebar.
2.	Create an alert simulation for VM:
    - On Security alerts page, click on **Sample alerts** button.
    - Select **Azure subscription 1**.
    - On the Workload Protections plans, keep only **Virtual Machines** selected.
    - Click on the **Create sample alerts** button to trigger the alert simulation for VMs.

3.	Sample alerts creation in progress, wait for the process to complete. You can track the progress by opening the notification center or on activity log (this process usually takes 2 minutes to complete)
4.	On the alerts page, you should now see 5 different sample events for a resource named `Sample-VM`. Each alert has the Sample alert banner next to it.

5.	Click on the **Digital currency mining related behavior detected alert**.
6.	The details pane opens. Notice the alert properties at the top (severity, status, and time) along with the alerts description and affected resources. At the bottom part, you can see the kill chain intent of the alert based on the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework. This specific alert is at the *Execution* phase.
7.	To explore the full details of the alert, click on **View full details**.
8.	Create an alert simulation for Key Vaults:
    - On Security alerts page, click on **Create sample alerts** button.
    - Select **Azure subscription 1**.
    - On the Workload Protections plans, keep only **Key Vaults** selected.
    - Click **Create sample alerts** button to trigger the alert simulation for Key Vaults.
9.	Sample alerts creating in progress, wait for the process to complete. You can track the progress by opening the notification center or on activity log (this process usually takes 2 minutes to complete)
10.	On the alerts page, you should now see 5 different sample events for a resource named `Sample-KV`. Each alert has the `Sample alert` banner next to it.
11.	Click on the **Access from a TOR exit node to a Key Vault** alert.
12.	Click on the **View full details** to see additional information related to the event.
13.	At the top menu, dismiss the alert by changing the status from Active to **Dismiss**.

> Note: You can choose to trigger sample alerts for additional Workload Protections plans.

### Exercise 2: Alert suppression

When a single alert isn't interesting or relevant, you can manually dismiss it.
In the previous step, we used the dismiss option to manually dismiss a single alert. However, you can use the suppression rules feature to automatically dismiss similar alerts in the future.

1.	From Microsoft Defender for Cloud sidebar, select **Security alerts**.
2.	Select **High volume of operations in a Key Vault** alert and then click on **Take action**.
3.	Expend the Suppress similar alerts section and click on **Create Suppression Rule**.
4.	The new suppression rule pane opens, provide a rule name: *Testing-AutoDismiss-KV*.
5.	On the reason field, select Other and leave a comment: *Lab 6 exercise*.
6.	Set rule expiration to be tomorrow (just a day ahead). **Click Apply and wait 10 minutes for the new rule to be applied.**
7.	Validate your alert suppression rule:
    - From the top menu, click on the **Create sample alerts** button.
    - Select the **Key vaults** plan only.
    - Click **Create sample alerts**.
    - You should now see only the new Key Vaults alerts **excluding the High volume of operations in a Key Vault**.
    - To test your rule, click **Simulate**.

> Note, you can create suppression rules on a management group level by using a built-in policy definition named Deploy - Configure suppression rules for Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts in Azure Policy. To suppress alerts at the subscription level, you can use the Azure portal or REST APIs.

1. You can change your existing suppression rules or create new ones: from the top menu, select **Suppression rules**. 
2. Click on the rule you have recently created: `Testing-AutoDismiss-KV`.
3.  Change the expiration to be a month ahead from the current date. Click **Apply**.
4.  View dismissed alerts: On the Security alerts main page, on the filters section, change the Status filter to show only **Dismissed** items.
5.  You should now expect to see only **1 dismissed alert**: High volume of operations in a Key Vault Sample alert.

### Exercise 3: Enable the integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Windows

[Workload Protections for servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/security-center/defender-for-servers-introduction) includes an integrated license for [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender). Together, they provide comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities.
When Defender for Endpoint detects a threat, it triggers an alert. The alert is shown in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. From Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can also pivot to the Defender for Endpoint console, and perform a detailed investigation to uncover the scope of the attack.
 
 
If you've never enabled the integration for Windows, the Allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to access my data option will enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud to deploy Defender for Endpoint to both your Windows and Linux machines.
1.	From Microsoft Defender for Cloud's menu, select **Environment settings** and select the subscription (**Azure Subscription 1**) with the Linux machines that you want to receive Defender for Endpoint.
2.	Then select **Integrations** from the sidebar.

3.	Select **Allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** to access my data (if it's not already on), and select **Save**.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud will:
1.	Automatically onboard your Windows and Linux machines to Defender for Endpoint
2.	Ignore any Linux machines that are running other fanotify-based solutions (see details of the fanotify kernel option required in [Linux system requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux#system-requirements))
3.	Detect any previous installations of Defender for Endpoint and reconfigure them to integrate with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
Onboarding might take up to 24 hours.
