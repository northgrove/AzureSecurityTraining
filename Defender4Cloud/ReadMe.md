## Introduction
This is a fork from [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Labs!](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Labs) adjusted to provide a one day workshop with Defender for Cloud training. For full version see the orgiginal repo.


## Prerequisites - OBS! Must be done **before** the workshop

To get full use of this one day you need to come prepared! That means that you must have prepared the lab environment in forhand. Which means that you **must** deploy this lab to a new subscription **before** you meet up for the workshop.

Module 1 represents the prerequesites. the whole module must be completed!
- Step 1: create a new Trial Subscription - this can anly be done if you are eligible for it and have not created a free subscription before. If you are *not* eligibel for a free subscription you can use any other paid subscription you my have or have available thru your employer. The lab will be created within a resourcegroup and can easly be deleted after the workshop.
- Step 2: Provision the resources in this lab
- Step 3: Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud

See this README for full description of the prerequisites: [**Prerequisites for Azure Security Trainging**](../README.md)
