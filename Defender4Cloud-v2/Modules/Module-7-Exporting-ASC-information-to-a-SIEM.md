## Objectives
In this exercise, you will understand how to configure the continuous export for Log Analytics workspace, exporting security alerts, recommendations, secure score, and security findings. Moreover, you will learn how to enable the integration between Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Azure Sentinel. You will also learn how to auto provision the Azure Policy's Guest Configuration extension.

### Exercise 1: Using continuous export

1.	On Microsoft Defender for Cloudâ€™s sidebar, click on **Environment settings**
2. Select **Azure subscription 1**.

3.	From the sidebar, click on **Continuous export**.
4.	Here you can configure streaming export setting of Microsoft Defender for Cloud data to multiple export targets either Event Hub or Log Analytics workspace.
5.	Select the **Log Analytics workspace** option.
6.	On the Exported data types, select **Security recommendations, Secure score and Security alerts** â€“ as you can see, all recommendations, severities, controls, and alerts are selected.

7.	On the Export configuration, select a resource group: *asclabs*
8.	On the Export target, select the target Log Analytics workspace: *asclab-la-xxx*
9.	Click on the **Save** button on the top menu.

> Note: Exporting Microsoft Defender for Cloud's data also enables you to use experiences such as integration with 3rd-party SIEM and Azure Data Explorer.

10.	On the Azure portal, navigate to **Log Analytics workspaces** service or [click here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.OperationalInsights%2Fworkspaces).
11.	Click on the **asclab-la-xxx** workspace.
12.	From the workspaceâ€™s sidebar, click on the **Logs** button.
13.	On the welcome page, click on the **Get Started** button and then **close the Queries window**.
14.	From the left pane, expand, Security and Audit. Notice the following tables under Security and Audit:  `SecureScoreControls`, `SecureScores`, `SecurityAlert`, `SecurityNestedRecommendation`, `SecurityRecommendation` and `SecurityRegulatoryCompliance`.
15.	At any point, administrators can run custom queries by using these tables provided by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

### Exercise 2: Integration with Azure Sentinel

1.	On the Azure portal, navigate to **Azure Sentinel** service or [click here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security_Insights/WorkspaceSelectorBlade).
2.	On the Azure Sentinel workspaces, click on **+ Create** workspace button â€“ for this exercise weâ€™ll use the same Log Analytics workspace used by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

3.	On the **Add Azure Sentinel** to a workspace, select **asclab-la-xxx** workspace. Click **New** on the top bar, or click **Create Azure Sentinel**. 
4.	Adding Azure Sentinel to workspace asclab-la-xxx is now in progress. The process will few minutes. 
5.	Once Sentinel News and guides opens, use the Microsoft Defender for Cloud connector to enable the integration.
6.	From Sentinelâ€™s sidebar, click on the **Data connectors**.
7.	On the Data connectors page, use the search field and type: **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and select it, and then click on **Open connector page**.

8.	On the Configuration section, locate the **Azure subscription 1** and change the Status toggle button to **Connect**. Wait for the connection status to be: `Connected`.

9. Ensure that **Bi-directional sync** is **Enabled**.

> **Note on Microsoft Defender for Cloud & Sentinel bi-directional alerts:**
When you connect Microsoft Defender for Cloud to Azure Sentinel, the status of Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts that get ingested into Azure Sentinel is synchronized between the two services. So, for example, when an alert is closed in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, that alert will display as closed in Azure Sentinel as well. Changing the status of an alert in Microsoft Defender for Cloud "won't"* affect the status of any Azure Sentinel incidents that contain the synchronized Azure Sentinel alert, only that of the synchronized alert itself.<br/>
Enabling this preview feature, bi-directional alert synchronization, will automatically sync the status of the original Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts with Azure Sentinel incidents that contain the copies of those Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts. So, for example, when an Azure Sentinel incident containing an Microsoft Defender for Cloud alert is closed, Microsoft Defender for Cloud will automatically close the corresponding original alert.

### Exercise 3: Microsoft Defender for Cloud can now auto provision the Azure Policy's Guest Configuration extension (in preview)
Azure Policy can audit settings inside a machine, both for machines running in Azure and Arc connected machines. The validation is performed by the Guest Configuration extension and client. Learn more in [Understand Azure Policy's Guest Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration).
With this update you can now set Microsoft Defender for Cloud to automatically provision this extension to all supported machines.
1.	In Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud, click on **Environment Settings**.
2.	Then select **Auto provisioning** from the sidebar.
3.	Here, for **Guest Configuration agent**, toggle the status to be **On**.
4.	Then click **Save**.

The guest configuration agent checks machines running in Azure and Arc Connected Machines for security misconfigurations. Settings such as configuration of the operating system, application configurations, and environment settings are all validated. To learn more, see [Understand Azure Policy's Guest Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Security).
